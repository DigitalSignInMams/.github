"MAMS SISO" stands for Mass Academy Sign-In and Sign-Out system, and is a production-level system designed to streamline and improve the sign-in and sign-out processes at Mass Academy.

**Key Features:**
MAMS SISO offers several key features to enhance the sign-in and sign-out process:

1. _Updated Security:_ The system prioritizes security with JWT OAuth for admin users and RFID to SQL connections that are verified over WPI's Linux servers, adhering to industry standards within the usage of MySQL.
2. _Minimal Maintenance:_ The system requires minimal maintenance, typically only at the end of the school year. Administrators can make necessary adjustments through the web application.
3. _Verified Logging:_ Each student's sign-in is verified using unique RFID hashes, ensuring accurate tracking and reducing errors in attendance records.
4. _User-Friendly Interface:_ Administrators can easily access the user interface (UI/UX) to monitor daily attendance, holidays, and events for accurate results.
5. _Environmentally Friendly:_ MAMS SISO reduces the need for paper sign-in and sign-out records, making it more environmentally friendly.

**Primary Speciality:**
MAMS SISO specializes in real-time logging and updates, minimizing latency in data retrieval from log-ins. It provides instantaneous updates for administrators and users.

**Secondary Specialities:**
Methodical Testing Cycle: Before full implementation, the system underwent a thorough 4-month testing period to ensure optimal performance for both users and administrators.

**The Team:**
The MAMS SISO Group consists of Tarun Eswar, Charles Tang, and David Barsoum.
